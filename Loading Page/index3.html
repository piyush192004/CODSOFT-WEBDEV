      <p>
        Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) is the space agency of India.
        The organisation is involved in science, engineering and technology to
        harvest the benefits of outer space for India and the mankind. ISRO is a
        major constituent of the Department of Space (DOS), Government of India.
        The department executes the Indian Space Programme primarily through
        various Centres or units within ISRO.
        <br />
        ISRO was previously the Indian National Committee for Space Research
        (INCOSPAR), set up by the Government of India in 1962, as envisioned by
        Dr. VikramA Sarabhai. ISRO was formed on August 15, 1969 and superseded
        INCOSPAR with an expanded role to harness space technology. DOS was set
        up and ISRO was brought under DOS in 1972.
        <br />
        The prime objective of ISRO/DOS is the development and application of
        space technology for various national needs. To fulfil this objective,
        ISRO has established major space systemsfor communication, television
        broadcasting and meteorological services; resources monitoring and
        management; space-based navigation services. ISRO has developed
        satellite launch vehicles, PSLV and GSLV, to place the satellites in the
        required orbits.
        <br />
        Alongside its technological advancement, ISRO contributes to science and
        science education in the country. Various dedicated research centres and
        autonomous institutions for remote sensing, astronomy and astrophysics,
        atmospheric sciences and space sciences in general function under the
        aegis of Department of Space. ISRO's own Lunar and interplanetary
        missions along with other scientific projects encourage and promote
        science education, apart from providing valuable data to the scientific
        community which in turn enriches science.
